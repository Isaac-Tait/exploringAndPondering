If you are wondering what is up with my handle Sticky Fingers (on Instagram and Threads it is stickyFingers1415) let me explain.

A while back I had decided that I wanted to put my journey out of the white, evangelical, fundamentalist, home-schooled, calvinist, christian upbringing that followed me through basically my entire adulthood until 2020. It seems there is a lot of content out about people divorcing themselves from what they used to be. Oftentimes this separation causes a lot of turmoil, anxiety, and loneliness. The fact that many who find themselves in this camp also come from backgrounds of abuse. My story is sadly the same as many who are deconstructing and disentangling their faith.

However, I wanted my platform to focus less on where I have been and more on where I am going. I read this in the Dalai Lama's book "The Art of Happiness" and I think it describes quite well what my aim was in launching my own deconstructing/disentangling blog.

> life is change. And to the degree that we refuse to accept this fact and resist the natural life changes, we will continue to perpetuate our own suffering. The acceptance of change can be an important factor in reducing a large measure of our self-created suffering. So often, for instance, we cause our own suffering by refusing to relinquish the past. If we define our self-image in terms of what we used to look like or in terms of what we used to be able to do and can’t do now, it is a pretty safe bet that we won’t grow happier...

So, I had a direction but I had no idea what my handle should be. As I was sitting on the sofa pondering this conundrum I was listening to Above and Beyond's album ["We Are All We Need"](https://open.spotify.com/album/6coJxgM3dkzZbbuPBVVcOW?si=iwjVvR4KSHuZnc8fTidlxg) when the song came on "Sticky Fingers" and it just seemed so fitting:

> We painted the picture you want
> I wanted it too
> But now there is something I want you to do
> Get your sticky fingers out of my head

I was freeing my mind, removing the sticky fingers of the modern church with all its shame, judgement, and harm.

My Instagram and Thread handle has 1415 at the end. John 14:15 has been my anthem call these past few years.

> If you love me you will obey my commands.

Well what are those commands you may ask? (I am glad you asked btw)

1. Love Me
2. Love you neighbors

Well if you aren't loving your neighbor than you are not obeying His commands which means you don't love Him. So, EVERYTHING hinges on you loving your neighbor - NO MATTER WHAT.

I also like the idea of sticky fingers because through my deconstruction/disentangling process I have dipped my "hands" into a wide array of religious and spiritual ways of thinking and seen what stuck so to speak. Aspects of Buddhism and even Atheism I have founded intriguing and worthy of further investigation. So, sticky fingers - yea I guess it works.

So, that is how I came up with my moniker. Let me know where you are on your journey, I would love to hear your perspective. Namaste :peace:
