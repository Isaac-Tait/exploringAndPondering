Last year in November I joined a writers group. It is called the [Queer and Affirming Writers Collective](https://www.mikemaeshiro.com/writers-group) and is run by none other than the illustrious and wonderful queer Pastor Mike Maeshiro. In March the group held a writing competition to see who could write the most in 21 days. I ended up winning (barely), writing over 24,000 words. As a result of all that writing I finished book two in the series I have been writing for over fourteen years! Currently I only have [part one of book one](https://wormwoodsaga.com/) published. I am working on the novel nearly every day and I am getting closer to publishing the final two parts in book one and the three parts in book two. With the two books finished I have put book three, the next book in the series, on the back burner for a bit and have been writing my fourth book. This fourth book is a memoir about my de-conversion, deconstruction, and migration into Buddhism. I have been reading a fabulous book [You Are The Medicine](/docs/Medicine)
and it has proven to be captivating, inspiring, and in many ways shocking as the book speaks to experiences that happened before I read the book that I could not explain. To find out what I mean, you will just have to read the book review linked above.

So, I have been busy writing this year but no so busy coding... I love to code, and I love to write. However, with my new forays into activism I have not had the time for three passions that make me zero money. Sadly this means that coding has had to take a back seat. I am excited though that I may be landing my first coding job this summer. I don't want to count my eggs before they hatch though so I will refrain on giving any more details for right now.

That is all loyal readers. Go forth into the world in peace and know that you are special, unique, and lovely. Namaste ‚úåüèΩ
