The other day I did a short guided meditation entitled "Keeping it Simple and Easy". It got me thinking - how does one keep it simple and easy in the face of brutality, bullies, intolerance, and fear? Today is a milestone for the US. Do we become a police state monarchy or do we embrace our heritage as a democracy? <!-- truncate -->

There is a lot a confusion and mis/dis-information these days (on both sides I'll admit although the right takes the cake on doomsday imagery for sure). Maybe it won't be as bad as everyone says it will be if the alt-right xtian nationalists win... One can only hope.
I've been pondering about the idea of keeping it simple and easy. What would it look like if all the predicted negative outcomes from a right-wing platform of hate, intolerance, fear, loathing, malice, discontent, and guns came to pass?

Either way who ever becomes our next president there will be millions of people who are scared, angry, and resentful. One side has a lot of guns and has shown numerous times in the past a complete disdain for human life. What will they do if they lose? I do know one thing - they don't take losing well.

I recently wrote about [understanding the right](/blog/2024-10-23-democracy/) after listening to an Allan Watts podcast. His explanation of how america is the most paranoid nation on earth really hit home. He said this in the 70's. If he thought we were paranoid then what would he think now? Too many american's are absolutely deranged and devoid of any compassion or empathy. Why? I believe it stems directly from a lifetime of paranoia indoctrination. How else do you explain the fact that there are now [more guns in our country than people](https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/)? We are a nation filled with terror, a lack of trust in one another, and a deep hatred fueled by the intolerance of our neighbor. How does this end well?

Are there enough of us left to stem the tide of bigotry, xenophobia, hatred, intolerance, discontent, and fear? I don't think so... but I can hope that I am wrong. I just don't have much of that left in me. So, as of now I have resigned myself to feeling wrung out, exhausted, demoralized, and worried about the coming storm.
