# The Art of Happiness _A Handbook for Living_

# by HH Dalai Lama & Howard C. Cutler

I rarely give a book a five out of five star rating. The ones that made the five star cut:

**The Hobbit**<br />
**1Q84**<br />
**The Awakening of Malcom X**<br />
**The Universal Christ**<br />
**Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth**

After finishing The Art of Happiness I feel 100% confident to add it to my very short list of five star books.

## The purpose of life

The overarching purpose of our life is to be happy and to avoid suffering (which detracts from our happiness).

Everyone, and I mean _everyone_, already possess what they need to be happy - a mind.

If you want to be happy than you should seek out what brings you happiness. Part of this seeking is to identify the emotions that cause you unhappiness and suffering.

> Now for instance, hatred, jealousy, anger, and so on are harmful. We consider them negative states of mind because they destroy our mental happiness; once you harbor feelings of hatred or ill feeling towards someone, once you yourself are filled by hatred or negative emotions, then other people appear to you as also hostile. So as a result there is more fear, greater inhibition and hesitation, and a sense of insecurity. These things develop, and also loneliness in the midst of a world perceived as hostile. All these negative feelings develop because of hatred.

As a recently de-constructed evangelical christian (aka exvangelical) perhaps one of the most striking aspects of this book was the Buddhist belief that we (humans) are basically good, gentle, happiness seeking, and that we possess an underlying nature that is free of negative emotions or thoughts (Buddha Nature). As a Christian for 30 years I was taught and believed emphatically that I was a horrible sinner, that even my best intentions and actions were filthy rags. Buddhism's departure from this destructive doctrine was a breath of fresh air. When you believe that you are worthless and will only become worthy when you die and God lets you into heaven you spend your life immersed in shame, guilt, and fear.

## Intimacy & Compassion

Buddhists believe that all humans are endowed with the seed of compassion. Under the right conditions and with care and attention it can grow and help us live happier, more fulfilling lives. With this horrible way of viewing oneself.

> Once we conclude that the basic nature of humanity is compassionate rather than aggressive, our relationship to the world around us changes immediately. Seeing others as basically compassionate instead of hostile and selfish helps us relax, trust, live at ease. It makes us happier.

## Suffering

Suffering is caused by **ignorance** which is what **greed** and **hatred** stems from. What is the opposite of these vices? Wisdom, generosity, and compassion.

We come into this world addicted to our misery, to our anger, to our unhappiness.

## Overcoming
