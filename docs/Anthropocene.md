### When Time Is Short: Finding Our Way in the Anthropocene by "Timothy Beal"

I bought the above titled book many months ago and promptly forgot about it for many months. While scrolling through my ever growing collection of unread books I came across it again and started reading. Within the first few pages I was hooked. I love to read, but I love collecting books to read more than I love to read. Currently I am in the middle of reading at least a half dozen books. I tend to switch between the books I am reading based on the mood I am in at that moment. However, Timothy Beal's book was one I just could not put down and I read it exclusively for three or four days until it was complete.

# Key takeaways

- We are god's with anuses
- Immortality Vehicles
- White supremacy and capitalism are by products of a flawed translation of the bible
