> If you have come to help me, you are wasting your time.
> If you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.
    * LILLA WATSON, ABORIGINAL WISDOM KEEPER

> "Every human's purpose in this lifetime is to raise the consciousness of this planet and help it evolve to a greater state of love." I loved this wisdom. How do we help the Earth evolve to a greater state of love? We do this through engaging in our healing work and focusing on how our soul is calling us to share our gifts.
